🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Hand Gesture Recognition Game ✋✊✌️ Using OpenCV & MediaPipe 🎥✨

This program brings the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game to life using hand gesture recognition powered by OpenCV and MediaPipe! 🎉🎭 Now, two players can battle it out using their hand movements in front of a webcam—no buttons, no controllers, just pure gesture-based gameplay! 🖐️👊✌️

🛠️ How It Works:
📸 1. Webcam Input
🎥 The program captures live video from the webcam using OpenCV and processes each frame with MediaPipe Hands to detect hand landmarks. 🖐️

✋✊✌️ 2. Hand Gesture Recognition
🧠 The program determines each player’s move based on hand positions:
✅ Rock (✊): All fingers curled into a fist.
✅ Paper (🖐️): All fingers extended.
✅ Scissors (✌️): Only index and middle fingers extended.

⏳ 3. Game Timer & Logic
🕰️ A countdown appears on-screen:
🚦 "Ready?" → "3..." → "2..." → "1..." → "GO!"
👉 Once the timer hits GO!, the program captures the hand gestures from both players.

🤖 The moves are compared using classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
🏆 Rock beats Scissors
🏆 Scissors beats Paper
🏆 Paper beats Rock

🔎 The game determines the winner and displays the result on the screen! 🎊

🎨 4. Real-Time Display
🖥️ The webcam feed is displayed with:
🎨 Hand landmarks drawn on detected hands 🤚
⏱️ Live countdown timer & game messages ⏳
🏆 Final game result announcement 🎊
